Jungle King Â© 1982 Taito.

The player controls a Tarzan-like jungle man who must swing across vines in the forest, swim through a crocodile-infested river, jump and duck rocks while climbing a hill and rescue his woman from a pair of barbaric cannibals.

The game has four screens: a forest of swinging vines, a river of crocodiles, a hill of falling rocks and a camp where two native African warriors dance around striking their spears up and down where our hero's woman dangles above a boiling cauldron.
