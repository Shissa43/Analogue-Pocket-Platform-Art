# Analogue-Pocket-Platform-Art

Platform image files for the Analogue Pocket console and handheld Cores!

Go to the [Latest release page](https://github.com/Shissa43/Analogue-Pocket-Platform-Art/releases/tag/v0.2) and download your prefered console region art zip (USA_ or JAPAN_) and copy the .bin files to your Pocket's micro SD card's Platforms/_images folder.
You have a choice of HOME, ARCADE and SIMPLE.

The **Home** zip is my main content platform art files. It includes platform logo, system graphics, and a game banner shot.

The **Simple** zip are slightly edited for clarity (increased size/contrast, slight layout shift) from the [Spiritualize1997 art set](https://github.com/spiritualized1997/openFPGA-Platform-Art-Set). Many thanks to [Spiritualize1997](https://github.com/spiritualized1997) and [agg23](https://github.com/agg23) for the art work. I have now also added system specs/data to the platform art.

Some alternative artworks were added to fill out missing platforms (SegaMarkIII...).
Have fun!
