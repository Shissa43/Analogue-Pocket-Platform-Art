# Analogue-Pocket-Platform-Art

Platform image files for the Analogue Pocket console and handheld Cores!

Go to the [Latest release page](https://github.com/Shissa43/Analogue-Pocket-Platform-Art/releases/tag/v0.2.5) and download your prefered console region art zip (USA_ or JAPAN_) and copy the .bin files to your Pocket's micro SD card's Platforms/_images folder.
You have a choice of HOME, ARCADE and SIMPLE.

◎　The **Home** zip is my main content platform art files. It includes platform logo, system graphics, and a game banners for consoles and handheld systems (no computers). I tried to use the original logo content of these systems when they were released. The system art comes from a wide variety of source from various internet info sites and were edited to fit the banner style.

◎　The **Simple** zip are slightly edited for clarity (increased size/contrast, slight layout shift) from the [Spiritualize1997 art set](https://github.com/spiritualized1997/openFPGA-Platform-Art-Set). Many thanks to [Spiritualize1997](https://github.com/spiritualized1997) and [agg23](https://github.com/agg23) for the art work. I have now also added system specs/data to the platform art.

◎　The **Arcade** zip contains only arcade systems. Some banner .bin names are the same for regional differences of these games (mainly in language/title). 


-Arcade content currently includes:
[Boogermann](https://github.com/opengateware), [antongale](https://github.com/antongale), [ericlewis](https://github.com/ericlewis), [agg23](https://github.com/agg23/openfpga-pong), [CoinUpCollection](https://github.com/Coin-OpCollection/Distribution-OpenFPGA), [nullobject](https://github.com/nullobject/openfpga-tecmo), [AsesomeDolphin](https://github.com/AwesomeDolphin), [somhi](https://github.com/somhi/FlappyBird), [spacemen3](https://github.com/spacemen3/PDP-1) and all public Jotego cores.

Some alternative artworks were added to fill out missing platforms (SegaMarkIII...).
Have fun!
